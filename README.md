# **Data Analysis Project: [Customer Behavior Analysis]**

## **Overview**

This project demonstrates end-to-end data analysis and visualization workflow, showcasing skills in **Python, SQL, PostgreSQL, and Power BI**. The goal was to extract insights from the dataset, perform thorough data cleaning and exploration, and create a **dynamic, interactive dashboard** along with a report and presentation for stakeholders.

---

## **Dataset**

* **Source:** [Provide source, e.g., Kaggle, internal data, etc.]
* **Description:** The dataset contains [brief description, e.g., customer transactions, sales data, product details].
* **Size:** [Number of rows & columns, e.g., 50,000 rows × 10 columns]
* **Key Columns:** [Highlight important fields, e.g., `customer_id`, `purchase_amount`, `subscription_status`]

## **Tools & Technologies**

* **Python:** For data loading, cleaning, and exploratory data analysis (EDA)
* **Pandas & NumPy:** Data manipulation and calculations
* **Matplotlib & Seaborn:** Visualization during EDA
* **PostgreSQL:** Storing and querying the data using SQL
* **Power BI:** Building interactive dashboards
* **Microsoft Office / PowerPoint:** Creating a presentation to summarize findings

---

## **Steps / Methodology**

1. **Data Loading & Exploration (Python)**

   * Loaded dataset using Pandas
   * Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand structure, distribution, and correlations

2. **Data Cleaning & Transformation**

   * Handled missing values and duplicates
   * Standardized column names and data formats
   * Created new derived features for analysis

3. **Database Integration (PostgreSQL)**

   * Loaded cleaned data into PostgreSQL
   * Wrote SQL queries to aggregate and summarize data
   * Verified data integrity and correctness

4. **Dashboard Creation (Power BI)**

   * Connected Power BI to PostgreSQL database
   * Created interactive charts, tables, and KPIs
   * Designed dashboard for key insights such as trends, top-performing categories, and customer segments

5. **Reporting & Presentation**

   * Summarized findings in a written report
   * Prepared a professional **PowerPoint presentation** using the GEMMA structure (Goal, Explore, Metrics, Model, Analysis)

---

## **Dashboard Features**

* Interactive filtering by customer segment, time period, and category
* Visualizations include:

  * Sales trends over time
  * Top customers and products
  * Distribution of purchase amounts
* Key metrics displayed using cards: Total Sales, Average Purchase, Repeat Customers

---

## **Results / Insights**

* Identified **top-performing customer segments** and products
* Detected patterns in purchase behavior and subscription trends
* Provided actionable insights to improve marketing and sales strategy

---

## **How to Run the Project**

1. **Python Scripts:**

   * Install dependencies:

     ```bash
     pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn psycopg2
     ```
   * Run the Jupyter notebooks for data cleaning and EDA.

2. **PostgreSQL:**

   * Ensure PostgreSQL server is running
   * Create database and tables using the provided SQL scripts
   * Load the cleaned dataset into the database

3. **Power BI:**

   * Open the Power BI file (`.pbix`)
   * Connect to the PostgreSQL database
   * Refresh the data to view the latest dashboard

4. **Report & Presentation:**

   * Open the report PDF and PPT file for detailed insights and recommendations
